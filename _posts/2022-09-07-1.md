I've recently been made aware of the value of git/github. 
So once my school and fatherhood responsibilities are met, I spend a fair amount of time learning about what all of this actually is. 
Github makes sense. It seems to be a place for developers to show/share their work and collaborate. 
Now git - still working on that one. Been spending too much time on concepts and not enough time DOING stuff. 
I promise to get my hands dirty tomorrow.
