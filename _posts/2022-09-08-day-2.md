Spent this evening learning about some newer concepts - namely serialization and unit testing - and messing around with intellij. 
If blue j is a plane built by the wright brothers - intellij is a 747. still contending with the learning curve though. also spent some time 
on git - attempting to push my school project to a new repo via command line. failure. will revisit tomorrow.
