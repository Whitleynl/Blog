Able to get back to the CSV file writer project tonight...was looking at the code and decided to look into the BufferedWriter class.
realized how important it is to know the tools you're working with. Otherwise you're just working by memorization and stabs in the dark. 
I'd like to have a deeper understanding. By reading the documentation, I suppose you can come to an understanding of what the tools are, 
why they exist, and how they're used - instead of just grabbing them and shoving them into your project.
